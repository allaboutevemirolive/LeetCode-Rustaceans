The question is asking you to remove all occurrences of a specific value (val) from an integer array (nums) and return the number of elements in the modified array that are not equal to the removed value.

To solve the problem, you need to perform the following steps:

1. Modify the array in-place: You should remove all occurrences of the given value (val) from the array (nums) without changing the order of the other elements.

2. Count the remaining elements: After removing the value, count the number of elements in the modified array that are not equal to val. Let's call this count k.

3. Return the count: Return the value of k, which represents the number of elements in the modified array that are not equal to val.

To validate your solution, a custom judge will test your code using the following procedure:

- It will provide you with an input array (nums), a value to remove (val), and the expected answer (expectedNums) in the form of another array that has the correct length and is sorted with no values equaling val.
- Your implementation should remove the value from the input array and return the count (k).
- The judge will compare the returned count with the length of expectedNums. If they are equal, it means the count is correct.
- The first k elements of the modified array will be sorted, and the judge will compare them with the corresponding elements of expectedNums. If they are equal, it means the modified array is correct.

Here are a couple of examples to help you understand the problem:

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
- The given array is [3, 2, 2, 3], and the value to remove is 3.
- After removing all occurrences of 3, the modified array is [2, 2, _, _].
- The first two elements of the modified array are 2, so k = 2.
- The remaining underscores (_) can contain any values and are not important.
- The expectedNums can be any sorted array with a length of 2 that doesn't have the value 3.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5
Explanation:
- The given array is [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0, 4, 2], and the value to remove is 2.
- After removing all occurrences of 2, the modified array is [0, 1, 4, 0, 3, _, _, _].
- The first five elements of the modified array are 0, 1, 4, 0, 3, so k = 5.
- The remaining underscores (_) can contain any values and are not important.
- The expectedNums can be any sorted array with a length of 5 that doesn't have the value 2.

The constraints of the problem are:
- The length of nums can be between 0 and 100.
- The values in nums can range from 0 to 50.
- The value to remove, val, can range from 0 to 100.



Solution 1 :

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn remove_element(nums: &mut Vec<i32>, val: i32) -> i32 {
        nums.retain(|i| i != &val);
        nums.len() as i32
    }
}
```

Solution 2 :

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn remove_element(nums: &mut Vec<i32>, val: i32) -> i32 {
        nums.retain(|&x| x != val);
        nums.len() as i32
    }
}
```

Test case :

```rust
fn main() {
    // Test case 1: Multiple occurrences of val
    let mut nums1 = vec![3, 2, 2, 3];
    let val1 = 3;
    let result1 = remove_element(&mut nums1, val1);
    println!("Test Case 1:");
    println!("Input: nums = {:?}, val = {}", nums1, val1);
    println!("Output: {}", result1);
    println!("Modified nums: {:?}", nums1);
    println!("Expected Output: 2");

    // Test case 2: No occurrences of val
    let mut nums2 = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
    let val2 = 5;
    let result2 = remove_element(&mut nums2, val2);
    println!("Test Case 2:");
    println!("Input: nums = {:?}, val = {}", nums2, val2);
    println!("Output: {}", result2);
    println!("Modified nums: {:?}", nums2);
    println!("Expected Output: 4");

    // Test case 3: All occurrences of val
    let mut nums3 = vec![5, 5, 5, 5];
    let val3 = 5;
    let result3 = remove_element(&mut nums3, val3);
    println!("Test Case 3:");
    println!("Input: nums = {:?}, val = {}", nums3, val3);
    println!("Output: {}", result3);
    println!("Modified nums: {:?}", nums3);
    println!("Expected Output: 0");
}

Let's go through the Rust code and explain it based on the factors you mentioned.

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn remove_element(nums: &mut Vec<i32>, val: i32) -> i32 {
        nums.retain(|i| i != &val);
        nums.len() as i32
    }
}
```

## Problem understanding:

The code implements a function `remove_element` as part of the `Solution` struct. This function takes a mutable reference to a vector of integers `nums` and an integer `val`. It removes all occurrences of `val` from the vector and returns the number of remaining elements.

## Approach overview:

The code uses the `retain` method on the vector `nums` to remove elements that are equal to `val`. The `retain` method modifies the vector in-place and keeps only the elements that satisfy the given condition.

## Algorithmic complexity:

The time complexity of the `retain` method is O(n), where n is the length of the vector. It iterates over all elements of the vector once to determine which elements to keep. The `len` method used to calculate the length of the modified vector has a time complexity of O(1). Therefore, the overall time complexity of the code is O(n).

## Data structures used:

The code uses a vector (`Vec<i32>`) to store the input integers. Vectors in Rust provide dynamic arrays that can grow or shrink as needed.

## Code walkthrough:

1. The `retain` method is called on the vector `nums`. It takes a closure as an argument, which specifies the condition for elements to be retained. In this case, the closure checks if an element `i` is not equal to `val`.
2. The `retain` method removes all elements from `nums` that do not satisfy the condition, effectively removing all occurrences of `val`.
3. The `len` method is called on the modified vector `nums` to get the number of remaining elements.
4. The length is converted to an `i32` using the `as` keyword and returned as the result of the function.

## Edge cases and constraints:

The code doesn't explicitly handle any specific edge cases or constraints. However, since the `retain` method is used, the code will correctly handle an empty input vector (`nums` with length 0). The constraints mentioned in the question are satisfied by the code's approach.

## Testing and validation:

The code should be tested with various inputs, including different values for `nums` and `val`, to ensure it produces the expected results. The provided examples can serve as initial test cases.

## Alternative approaches:

The code uses a simple and efficient approach by leveraging the `retain` method. An alternative approach could involve iterating over the vector, copying non-matching elements to a new vector, and returning its length. However, this would require additional memory allocation and copying, making it less efficient.

## Error handling and robustness:

The code assumes that the inputs are valid and within the specified constraints. It doesn't include explicit error handling or validation for out-of-bounds values or invalid inputs. In a real-world scenario, additional checks and error handling might be necessary.

## Trade-offs and optimizations:

The code focuses on simplicity and readability. It removes all occurrences of `val` using the `retain` method, which provides a concise way to modify the vector in-place. The code doesn't prioritize memory efficiency or other optimization techniques since the problem constraints are relatively small.

## Lessons learned:

The code demonstrates the use of the `retain` method to modify a vector in-place by removing elements that don't satisfy a given condition. It showcases how Rust's vector provides convenient methods to manipulate data efficiently.

Overall, the code provides a straightforward and efficient solution to the problem, meeting the requirements and constraints mentioned in the question.

Explain to me in details for this line
    
```rust
nums.retain(|i| i != &val);
```


Certainly! Let's break down the line `nums.retain(|i| i != &val);` and explain its functionality in detail:

1. `nums`: It refers to the vector of integers that is passed as a parameter to the `remove_element` function. This vector contains the elements that need to be modified.

2. `retain`: `retain` is a method provided by the `Vec` type in Rust. It modifies the vector in-place and keeps only the elements that satisfy a given condition. Any element that doesn't satisfy the condition will be removed from the vector.

3. `|i| i != &val`: This is a closure or anonymous function that is passed as an argument to the `retain` method. It defines the condition for retaining elements in the vector. In this case, the closure compares each element `i` in the vector with the value `val` using the `!=` operator.

4. `i`: It represents each individual element in the vector `nums` during iteration.

5. `i != &val`: The expression `i != &val` compares the element `i` with the reference to `val`. The `&` symbol is used to create a reference to the value `val`.

   - If `i` is not equal to `val`, the closure returns `true`, indicating that the element should be retained.
   - If `i` is equal to `val`, the closure returns `false`, indicating that the element should be removed.

6. Effect of `retain`: The `retain` method applies the closure to each element in the vector `nums` and keeps only those elements for which the closure returns `true`. It removes all elements that do not satisfy the condition specified in the closure.

   - Elements that are not equal to `val` will be retained in the vector.
   - Elements that are equal to `val` will be removed from the vector.

So, `nums.retain(|i| i != &val);` essentially removes all occurrences of the value `val` from the vector `nums`, while keeping all other elements intact. After this line of code is executed, the vector `nums` will only contain the elements that are not equal to `val`.

It's important to note that the `retain` method modifies the vector in-place, meaning it modifies the original vector directly without creating a new vector. This is why there is no need to assign the result back to `nums`. The vector `nums` will be modified directly by the `retain` method.
