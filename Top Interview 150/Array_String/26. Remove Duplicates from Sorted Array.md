The task is to remove duplicate elements from an array called `nums` that is sorted in non-decreasing order. We need to modify the array in-place so that each unique element appears only once. The order of the unique elements should be maintained, and we need to return the count of the unique elements.

To solve this task, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable `k` to 0 to keep track of the count of unique elements.

2. Iterate through the elements of the array starting from the second element (index 1) since the first element is always considered unique.

3. Compare each element with the previous element. If the current element is different from the previous element, it means it is a new unique element.

4. If a new unique element is found, increment `k` by 1 and update the value at index `k` with the current element. This will effectively shift the unique elements towards the beginning of the array.

5. After iterating through all the elements, the first `k+1` elements of the array will contain the unique elements in the order they were initially present.

6. Return `k+1` as the count of unique elements.

For example, let's consider the array `nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]`:

- At the first iteration, `nums[1]` is compared with `nums[0]`. Since they are the same, it means it's not a new unique element.
- At the second iteration, `nums[2]` is compared with `nums[1]`. Since they are different, it means `nums[2]` is a new unique element.
- We increment `k` to 1 and update `nums[k+1]` (equivalent to `nums[2]`) with the value of `nums[2]`.
- The array after the first two iterations becomes: `nums = [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]`.
- We continue this process for the remaining elements.
- After the iterations, the array becomes `nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4, 4]`.
- The first `k+1` elements are `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, which are the unique elements in the order they were initially present.
- We return `k+1 = 5` as the count of unique elements.

The constraint for this task is that the length of the array `nums` is between 1 and 3 * 10^4, and the elements are within the range of -100 to 100.


Solution 1:

This code leverage the fact that the next number is `unique`.

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn remove_duplicates(nums: &mut Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
        let mut ptr = 0;
        for i in 1..nums.len() {
            if(nums[i] != nums[ptr]) {
                nums[ptr+1] = nums[i];
                ptr+=1;
            }
        }
        (ptr+1 ) as i32
    }
}
```

Solution 2 (much faster):

This code leverage the fact that the next number is `bigger` than the previous one.

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn remove_duplicates(nums: &mut Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
        let mut writer = 1;
        let n = nums.len();

        for reader in 1..n {
            if nums[reader] > nums[reader - 1] {
                nums[writer] = nums[reader];
                writer += 1;
            }
        }

        writer as i32
    }
}
```

Factors:

1. Problem understanding:
The problem is to remove duplicate elements from a sorted array in-place, maintaining the order of unique elements and returning the count of unique elements.

2. Approach overview:
The code follows a two-pointer approach. It initializes a pointer `ptr` to keep track of the current position for unique elements. Then it iterates through the array starting from the second element, comparing each element with the previous element. If a new unique element is found, it updates the element at position `ptr+1` with the new element and increments `ptr`. Finally, it returns the count of unique elements.

3. Algorithmic complexity:
The `time complexity` of the code is O(n) because it iterates through the array once. Here, `n` represents the length of the input array.
The `space complexity` is O(1) because the code operates in-place and does not use any additional data structures that scale with the input size.

4. Data structures used:
The code uses a mutable vector `nums` to represent the input array. It also uses a mutable variable `ptr` to keep track of the position of unique elements.

5. Code walkthrough:
The code begins by defining the function `remove_duplicates` as a method of the `Solution` struct. It takes a mutable reference to a vector of `i32` called `nums` as input and returns an `i32` representing the count of unique elements.

Inside the function, it initializes the variable `ptr` to 0. Then it iterates through the array using a for loop, starting from the second element (index 1) using the range `1..nums.len()`.

Inside the loop, it compares the current element `nums[i]` with the element at position `ptr` using `nums[i] != nums[ptr]`. If they are different, it means it's a new unique element. In that case, it updates the element at position `ptr+1` with the current element using `nums[ptr+1] = nums[i]`, and increments `ptr` by 1.

After the loop, it returns `(ptr+1) as i32`, which represents the count of unique elements.

6. Edge cases and constraints:
The code assumes that the input array is sorted in non-decreasing order. It also assumes that the length of the array `nums` is between 1 and 3 * 10^4, and the elements are within the range of -100 to 100.

7. Testing and validation:
The code itself does not include any specific testing or validation. However, you can test it by calling the `remove_duplicates` function with different input arrays and verifying if it returns the correct count of unique elements and modifies the array as expected.

8. Alternative approaches:
An alternative approach to solve this task is to use the `dedup` method provided by Rust's standard library for vectors. It automatically removes consecutive duplicate elements from the vector and returns the count of unique elements. However, this approach does not maintain the original order of unique elements.

9. Error handling and robustness:
The code does not include explicit error handling or input validation. It assumes the input vector is valid and handles the task based on the given constraints.

10. Trade-offs and optimizations:
The code follows a simple and efficient approach, leveraging the fact that the array is already sorted. It avoids using additional data structures and operates in-place, which results in optimal space complexity. However, it is worth noting that this approach modifies the original array, which may not always be desirable.

11. Lessons learned:
This code provides an example of how to efficiently remove duplicate elements from a sorted array in-place. It demonstrates the use of a two-pointer approach and highlights the importance of understanding the problem constraints and leveraging any given properties of the input data to optimize the solution.

The line below will iterate over each element in ascending order. 

What if we want to iterate in descending order, increment by 5, or decrement by 10?

```rust
for i in 1..nums.len() {
    // ...
}
```
===

To iterate in `descending` order, you can use the `rev` method on the range. Here's an example of iterating in descending order:

```rust
for i in (1..nums.len()).rev() {
    // Code here
}
```

To `increment by 5`, you can modify the range expression by specifying the step value as 5. Here's an example:

```rust
for i in (1..nums.len()).step_by(5) {
    // Code here
}
```

To `decrement by 10`, you can modify the range expression by specifying the step value as -10. Here's an example:

```rust
for i in (1..nums.len()).step_by(-10) {
    // Code here
}
```

Note that when using `step_by`, you need to ensure that the step value is a valid divisor or negation of a valid divisor of the range size to avoid potential indexing errors.

What do you mean by the statements below? Explain to me in simple terms.


"Note that when using `step_by`, you need to ensure that the step value is a valid divisor or negation of a valid divisor of the range size to avoid potential indexing errors."

===

Certainly! Let's break down the statement:

"When using `step_by`, you need to ensure that the step value is a valid divisor or negation of a valid divisor of the range size to avoid potential indexing errors."

1. `step_by`: `step_by` is a method in Rust that allows you to specify the step value for iteration. It determines how the loop variable changes between each iteration.

2. `Step value`: The step value specifies the amount by which the loop variable is incremented or decremented in each iteration.

3. `Valid divisor`: A valid divisor is a number that divides another number without leaving a remainder. For example, 2 is a valid divisor of 10 because 10 divided by 2 equals 5 without a remainder.

4. `Negation`: Negation means changing the sign of a number. For example, the negation of 5 is -5.

5. `Range size`: The range size refers to the number of elements in the range, which is determined by the `nums.len()` expression in this case.

The statement is cautioning about potential indexing errors when using `step_by` with an invalid step value. To avoid such errors:

- If you are using a positive step value, make sure it is a valid divisor of the range size. For example, if the range size is 10, valid positive step values could be 1, 2, 5, or 10.

- If you want to decrement the loop variable using a negative step value, ensure that the absolute value of the step value is a valid divisor of the range size. For example, if the range size is 10, a valid negative step value could be -1, -2, -5, or -10.

By following these guidelines, you ensure that the loop variable remains within the valid index range of the collection you are iterating over, preventing potential errors such as accessing elements outside the collection or causing an infinite loop.

Explain to me in details for this line

```rust
nums.len() as i32
```

Certainly! Let's break down the line `nums.len() as i32` and explain its functionality in detail:

1. `nums`: It refers to the vector of integers that has been modified by removing elements equal to `val` using the `retain` method.

2. `len()`: `len()` is a method provided by the `Vec` type in Rust. It returns the length of the vector, which represents the number of elements it contains.

3. `as i32`: This is a type conversion expression that converts the length of the vector from the default unsigned integer type (`usize`) returned by `len()` to a signed integer type (`i32`).

   - `usize` is the default unsigned integer type used for indexing and representing the sizes of objects in memory. It can vary depending on the platform, typically 32 bits or 64 bits.
   - `i32` is a signed 32-bit integer type.

The purpose of converting the length to `i32` is to match the return type of the `remove_element` function, which is specified as `i32` in the function signature. This ensures that the function returns a value of the expected type.

Therefore, `nums.len() as i32` retrieves the length of the modified vector `nums` and converts it to a signed 32-bit integer (`i32`) to comply with the function's return type.

In the context of the problem, this line calculates the number of elements remaining in the vector `nums` after removing the elements equal to `val`. This value represents the count of elements in the modified vector that are not equal to `val`, which is the desired output according to the problem statement.

Why need to convert the ptr into signed integer type (`i32`)? In the code there is not specify that the integer already converted into unsigned integer type (`usize`).


(ptr+1 ) as i32

===

The reason for converting `ptr+1` to the signed integer type `i32` is to match the return type of the function as specified in the function signature.

In the given code, the function `remove_duplicates` has a return type of `i32`:

```rust
pub fn remove_duplicates(nums: &mut Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
    // Code here
}
```

The expression `(ptr+1) as i32` explicitly casts the result of `ptr+1` to `i32`. It ensures that the value returned by the function matches the expected return type.

The variable `ptr` is used as an index in the vector `nums`, which has a type of `usize` (unsigned integer type representing the size of the vector). However, the function is expected to return the count of unique elements as a signed integer (`i32`).

By explicitly converting `(ptr+1)` to `i32`, it ensures that the value returned by the function is a signed integer, as required by the function signature.
