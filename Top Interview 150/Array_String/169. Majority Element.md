169. Majority Element

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3


Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5 * 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
 

Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?




Solution 1: 

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn majority_element(nums: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
        let mut count = 0;
        let mut majority_el = 0;

        for i in nums {
            if count == 0 {
                majority_el = i;
            }
            if majority_el == i {
                count += 1;
            } else {
                count -= 1;
            }
        }
        
        majority_el
    }
}
```

Problem understanding:
The problem is asking for the majority element in an array, which is defined as the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times, where n is the size of the array. The task is to find and return the majority element from the given array.

Approach overview:
The provided code implements a solution to find the majority element in linear time and using O(1) space. It utilizes the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, which is an efficient algorithm for finding the majority element.

Algorithmic complexity:
The algorithm has a linear time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input array. This is because it iterates over the array once to find the majority element.

Data structures used:
The code uses a mutable integer variable `count` to keep track of the count of the majority element encountered so far. It also uses another mutable integer variable `majority_el` to store the current majority element.

Code walkthrough:
1. The function `majority_element` takes a vector `nums` of integers as input and returns an integer.
2. It initializes two mutable variables, `count` and `majority_el`, to 0.
3. It iterates over each element `i` in the input vector `nums`.
4. Inside the loop, it checks if `count` is 0, indicating that the previous majority element has been canceled out. In this case, it updates `majority_el` with the current element `i`.
5. It then checks if `majority_el` is equal to the current element `i`. If they are equal, it increments `count` by 1.
6. If `majority_el` is not equal to `i`, it means there is a different element that cancels out the majority element. In this case, it decrements `count` by 1.
7. After iterating over all the elements, it returns the majority element stored in `majority_el`.

Edge cases and constraints:
The code assumes that the majority element always exists in the array. It also assumes that the length of the input array `nums` is within the range of 1 to 5 * 104. The elements in the array are expected to be integers within the range of -109 to 109.

Testing and validation:
The code does not include any explicit testing or validation. However, it can be tested by providing different input arrays and verifying if the returned majority element is correct.

Alternative approaches:
The code implements the `Boyer-Moore Voting` Algorithm, which is an efficient approach to find the majority element in linear time and O(1) space. There are alternative approaches to solve this problem, such as sorting the array and returning the element at index n/2, or using a hash map to count the occurrences of each element.

Error handling and robustness:
The code does not include explicit error handling or robustness checks. It assumes that the input vector `nums` is valid and within the specified constraints.

Trade-offs and optimizations:
The Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm used in the code is an optimal solution for finding the majority element. It achieves linear time complexity and uses constant space, making it an efficient approach. There are no further trade-offs or optimizations implemented in the given code.

Lessons learned:
The provided code demonstrates the application of the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm to efficiently find the majority element in an array. Understanding and implementing such algorithms can help in solving similar problems that involve finding frequent elements or patterns in data.
